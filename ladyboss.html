            <h2>Research & Analysis</h2>
            <p>Conducting competitive research and UX analysis gave me insights of what was and wasn’t working in existing platforms, and a better understanding of who were our customers.
            <br>I then conducted interviews and surveys with 10+ women in that target group to deeply understand their feelings, needs & desires. I made sense of all the data using mental models, affinity & empathy maps.</p>

            <p>Luana was going through her business monthly expenses and realized she needs to start a budget for her company, but doesn’t know the best way to do so. 
            <br>She decides to join the LadyBoss platform and book a call with a finance expert.</p>

        <div>
            <p>With Luana’s objectives and tasks in mind, I created her user flows. I  then worked on the I.A., mapping the navigation, and after a couple rounds of card sorting with 6 people, I wrapped up the site map, which helped me move forward into the first sketches and low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p>Many points of friction and opportunities were pointed out through rounds of usability testing, with 6 participants in or close to our target group. 
            <br>They were given our persona’s scenario, and asked to complete a set of tasks to meet each user flow objective.
            <br>The first round was made in the early high-fidelity screen through Zoom. 
            <br>The second round was made in our finished prototype, in person, with two of the same participants, with the goal of validating the iterations made.
            <br>A few preference tests were also made for the main screens. such as the homepage and dashboard.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Creating this project, from ideation to prototyping was eye opening to the possibilities that come with rounds of testing and iteration. 
            <br>Deeply understanding the user and building empathy towards their needs was key to every design choice made throughout this process.  Keeping in mind, at all times, marketing and business goals, for a perfect balance on both sides. 
            <br>I look forward to continue working with products and services that empower people - and our planet.</p>
